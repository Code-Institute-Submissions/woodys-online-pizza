# Woodys Online Pizza!
Welcome to Woodys Online Pizza!
The concept is real simple.
Login or create your account with our site.
Proceed to the Toppings Page where you will choose as many toppings as you desire.
Once everything is confirmed, we will deliver the pizza to your door within 45 minutes.
Payment will be collected at time of delivery.

# Features
The user frendly design is tailored for a clean, no nonsense approach.
Its not a hard site to figure out.  Minimal text explanations.  The title of the
website pretty much explains it.  Its an online pizza site.
One size of pizza is offered to keep it simple. 
Since this project did not cover any user authentication, I have incorporated a very minimal
user login.  No passwords.  All you have to remember is your username to login.
And I collect only the minimum of user information.  I dont collect any credit card info.
I did use MongoDB as the database.  It consists of only two collections.  One for Toppings.
And the other for Users.  The pizza info is nested into the user collection so all the information is
contained together.

# TECHNOLOGY
This is a simple website consisting of mainly HTML in a BootStrap and Flask Framework.
CSS is used to control and decorate everything.  Flask was used for file management.
Bootstrap was used for layout and responsive design.
MongoDB was used as the backend DB.  It was my first time using a non-SQL database.
I found it quite refreshing and fun.  I will definitely be doing more projects and sites
in MongoDB.

# TESTING
Testing was done completely manually.
All links were checked.  All pages were tested.  Menu items were checked.
The website is fully responsive since we used Bootstrap as the Framework.
The website was tested at all screen sizes both by adjusting browser width and on actual devices.
I have an ancient iTouch, two iPhones, 3 iPads, an Android Tablet, two laptops and a three monitor desktop.
The site performed well with all devices.
